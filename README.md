# GPT

## Task
Assignment: Web Scraping and AI Model Training
Objective: Scrape data from the top 50 hospitals' websites and train a Private GPT model(available on Github) on this data.

Tasks:
* Data Collection: Identify the top 50 hospitals worldwide and scrape relevant data from their websites.
* Data Cleaning: Clean the scraped data and prepare it for model training.
* Model Training: Use the cleaned data to train a Private GPT model (available on github).
* Documentation: Document your process, findings, and the performance of the model.

Deliverables:

* A CSV or JSON file containing the scraped data.
* Python code for scraping, cleaning, and training.
* A report documenting your process and findings.
* A trained Private GPT model.


## Result

- [x] A CSV or JSON file containing the scraped data.
